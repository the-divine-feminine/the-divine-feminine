The Sun don't shine when I'm alone
I lose my mind and I lose control
I see your eyes look through my soul
Don't be surprised, this is all I know

I felt the highs and they felt like you
See, a love like mine is too good to be true
And you too divine to just be mine
You remind me of the color blue

Girl, I'm so in love with you, yeah
Girl, I'm so in love with you
