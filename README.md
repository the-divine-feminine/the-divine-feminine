 The Sun don't shine when I'm alone
 
 I lose my mind and I lose control

 I see your eyes look through my soul
 
 Don't be surprised, this is all I know

 I felt the highs and they felt like you
 
 See, a love like mine is too good to be true

 And you too divine to just be mine
 
 You remind me of the color blue

## Girl, I'm so in love with you, yeah
## Girl, I'm so in love with you ᡣ𐭩
